# jme-template
A sample jMonkeyEngine template project with basic configuration

## How to build ##
This library uses [gradle](https://gradle.org/gradle-download/) as build system, and comes with the gradle wrapper included.
So no prior installation on your computer is required! You can just use the `gradlew` or `gradlew.bat` executables in the root of the sources.

To start the application you just need to run the command:
```
gradlew run
```
